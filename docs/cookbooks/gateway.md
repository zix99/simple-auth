# Simple-Auth Gateway

Gateway is a simple way for *simple-auth* to act as an authentication gateway and reverse-proxy to a service.  This is great for low-volume sites, private setups, or testing, but you probably don't want to use *simple-auth* as a reverse-proxy in high-volume situations (for many reasons).
