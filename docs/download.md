# Download

There are two ways to get *simple-auth*, either as a binary or docker image.  No one way is preferred over the other, and it simply depends what fits in your stack.

## Docker Image

```sh
docker pull zix99/simple-auth:latest
```

## Binary

Download the binary from the <a :href="`${$themeConfig.repoUrl}/releases`" target="_blank">releases page</a>

## Next steps

See [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) or head to [Config](./config.md)
