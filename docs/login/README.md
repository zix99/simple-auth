# Login Providers

Login Providers are what allows a user to create an account with simple-auth

* [Local Login](local.md) allows a user to create a username/password, and optionally 2FA, directly with this simple-auth instance
* [OpenID Connect](oidc.md) allows a user to login with their favorite OIDC provider (google, etc)
